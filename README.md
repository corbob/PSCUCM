## Development status

PSCUCM was a project I started when I was looking to automate CUCM as I was administering a CUCM system. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. As such development on PSCUCM is all but stopped. I'll still entertain PRs, and submitted Issues, but may not get to them in a super timely manner.

## Helpful information

PSCUCM Uses AXL. Cisco maintains AXL information here: https://developer.cisco.com/site/axl/

Cisco has DevNet that allows you to spin up a test environment. It can be found here: https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology
